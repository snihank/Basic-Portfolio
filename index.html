        Hi! I am really excited to introduce myself to all of you. I am 
        Shakib Karim. I live in Queens in New York. I am currently working 
        JFK Airport as Passenger Service Agent for Kuwait Airways. In the past,
        I have worked in Unicef in Australia as a fund raiser. I have also worked
        in ACME Consumer goods in Bangladesh in Brand and Marketing. I always had 
        a passion for technology. I like to play with new devices and softwares. 
    </p>

        As I have product development experience in the past, and the IT market 
        is ever-evolving, I would like to try my luck in there. Meanwile, along with my interest 
        in new things I have decided to take a course in Web Development. As part of the curriculum
        I am designing a website of my own. 

    </p>

    <p class="p3">
        However, as this is an ongoing process, this website would be going under changes
        althroughout my career as I would be uploading new contents and updating my skills.
